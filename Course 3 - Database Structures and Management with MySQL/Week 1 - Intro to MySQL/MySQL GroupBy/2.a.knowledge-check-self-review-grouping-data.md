# Self review: Grouping data

1. True or False: The following SQL statement targets a table named "Orders" and groups rows that have the same OrderDate values into summary rows.
     
   ```SQL
   SELECT OrderDate FROM Orders GROUP BY OrderDate;
   ```
   ```
   Answer: True
   Explanation: The GROUP BY clause checks the Order tableâ€™s OrderDate column for duplicate values.
   It then summarizes the related rows using the data within this column.
   ```

2. LuckyShrub need to retrieve the total quantities of all orders that were placed with their business on the same day. Identify the missing syntax from the SQL statement that they've created to complete this task:

   ```SQL
   SELECT OrderDate, _________ FROM Orders GROUP BY OrderDate;
   ```
   ```SQL
   - COUNT(OrderQty)
   - SUM(OrderQty)
   - COUNT(OrderID)
      
   ```
   ```
   Answer: SUM(OrderQty)
   Explanation: SUM(OrderQty) aggregate function calculates the total order quantity.
   The GROUP BY clause groups the data by the OrderDate.
   ```

3. True or False: When grouping data by multiple columns, SQL reviews the Group BY column values to find combinations of repeasting or duplicate data. It then summarizes these rows.
   - True
   - False
     
   ```
   Answer: True
   Explanation: If a SELECT query specifies multiple columns in the GROUP BY clause, then it inspects the data in all those columns in order to identify repeating or duplicate value combinations of all the specified columns. It then summarizes the rows.
   ```

4. Which columns in the following table would be appropriate to include within a GROUP BY clause in a SQL statemnet? Select all that apply.

   - Department
   - OrderTotal
   - OrderQty
   - OrderID
   - OrderDate

     
   ```
   Answer: Department, OrderDate
   Explanation: This column can be used with the GROUP BY clause because it contains duplicate values.
   ```

5. True or False: If you remove the GROUP BY clause from a SQL SELECT statement, then the HAVING clause behaves in a similar manner to the WHERE clause.

   - True
   - False
   ```
   Answer: True
   Explanation: The HAVING clause is used in a GROUP BY query to filter grouped data. However, in the absence of GROUP BY clause, the HAVING clause behaves just like the WHERE clause.
   ```
