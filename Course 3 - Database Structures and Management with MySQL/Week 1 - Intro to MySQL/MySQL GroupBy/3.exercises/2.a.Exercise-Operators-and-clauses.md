# Exercise: Operators and clauses (Optional)




## Lab Instructions  

Lucky Shrub gardening center's database stores data on their employees, customer orders and the details of orders handled by employees.

To complete this exercise, keep MySQL terminal open from the previous lab, or use MySQL on your own machine. To install MySQL on your own machine you can follow the instructions provided in the link in the additional resources item in the first module.  

### Prerequisites  

You can use the following SQL scripts to set up the luckyshrub_db in your local environment.

```SQL
CREATE DATABASE luckyshrub_db; 
USE luckyshrub_db;
CREATE TABLE employees (
  EmployeeID int NOT NULL,
  EmployeeName varchar(150) DEFAULT NULL,
  Department varchar(150) DEFAULT NULL,
  ContactNo varchar(12) DEFAULT NULL,
  Email varchar(100) DEFAULT NULL,
  AnnualSalary int DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (EmployeeID)
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
  OrderID int NOT NULL,
  Department varchar(100) DEFAULT NULL,
  OrderDate date DEFAULT NULL,
  OrderQty int DEFAULT NULL,
  OrderTotal int DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (OrderID)
);

CREATE TABLE employee_orders (
 OrderID int NOT NULL,
 EmployeeID int NOT NULL,
 Status VARCHAR(150),
 HandlingCost int DEFAULT NULL,
 PRIMARY KEY (EmployeeID,OrderID),
 FOREIGN KEY (EmployeeID) REFERENCES employees(EmployeeID),
 FOREIGN KEY (OrderID) REFERENCES orders(OrderID)
);

## Examples of using ANY and ALL operators with the GROUP BY and HAVING clauses
The Lucky Shrub database contains a table called orders that stores data about orders placed by different departments.

There’s also the employees table that stores data about Lucky Shrub’s employees.

Finally, there’s an employee_orders table that stores data about the employees who are handling the orders.

## Tasks
**Task1: Use the ANY operator to identify all employees with the Order Status status 'Completed'.**

**Task 2: Use the ALL operator to identify the IDs of employees who earned a handling cost of "more than 20% of the order value" from all orders they have handled.**

**Task 3: Use the GROUP BY clause to summarize the duplicate records with the same column values into a single record by grouping them based on those columns.**

**Task 4: Use the HAVING clause to filter the grouped data in the subquery that you wrote in task 3 to filter the 20% OrderTotal values to only retrieve values that are more than $100.**

# Solutions
## Task 1 solution:
Use the ANY operator to identify all employees with the Order Status status 'Completed'. 

```
SELECT EmployeeId, EmployeeName  
FROM employees  
WHERE EmployeeID = ANY (SELECT EmployeeID FROM employee_orders WHERE Status='Completed');
```
This query returns all employee records that have an EmployeeID which matches ANY of the EmployeeIDs returned from the subquery. 

There are two employee records in the results set:

## Task 2 solution:
Use the ALL operator to identify the IDs of employees who earned a handling cost of "more than 20% of the order value" from all orders they have handled.

```
SELECT EmployeeID, HandlingCost
FROM employee_orders
WHERE HandlingCost > ALL(SELECT ROUND(OrderTotal*0.2) FROM orders);
```
This query returns all records from the employee_orders table that have a handling cost more than ALL the 20% values returned from the subquery. 

The result that’s returned by this query contains seven records, all from the same employee ID:

The same employee ID is repeated here because this employee has handled 7 orders. For all those orders, the employee has earned a handling cost of $300. 

## Task 3 solution: 
Use the GROUP BY clause to summarize the duplicate records with the same column values into a single record by grouping them based on those columns.

```
SELECT EmployeeID, HandlingCost
FROM employee_orders
WHERE HandlingCost > ALL(
SELECT ROUND(OrderTotal*0.2) 
FROM orders)
GROUP BY EmployeeID, HandlingCost;
```
Note that the data has been grouped by the two columns that have the same (or duplicate) values, which are EmployeeID and HandlingCost.

The result of this query contains one record:

The data now has been summarized to a single record. 

## Task 4 solution:
Use the HAVING clause to filter the grouped data in the subquery that you wrote in task 3 to filter the 20% OrderTotal values to only retrieve values that are more than $100.

This query is written as follows: 

```
SELECT EmployeeID, HandlingCost
FROM employee_orders
WHERE HandlingCost > ALL(
SELECT ROUND(OrderTotal*0.2) as twentypercent
FROM orders
GROUP BY OrderTotal
HAVING twentypercent > 100
)
GROUP BY EmployeeID, HandlingCost;
```
