### Prerequisites  

To complete this lab, you must have the Lucky Shrub database created in MySQL. You must also create and populate the Orders table with relevant data inside the Lucky Shrub database.

The code to create the database and the Orders table is as follows.

1: Create database 

```SQL 

CREATE DATABASE luckyshrub_db;

``` 

2: Use database

```SQL 

USE luckyshrub_db;
``` 

3: Create Orders table

```SQL 

CREATE TABLE Orders(OrderID INT, Department VARCHAR(100), OrderDate DATE, OrderQty INT, OrderTotal INT, PRIMARY KEY(OrderID));
``` 

4: The code to insert data into Orders table is as follows:
 
```SQL 

INSERT INTO Orders VALUES(1,'Lawn Care','2022-05-05',12,500),(2,'Decking','2022-05-22',150,1450),(3,'Compost and Stones','2022-05-27',20,780),(4,'Trees and Shrubs','2022-06-01',15,400),(5,'Garden Decor','2022-06-10',2,1250),(6,'Lawn Care','2022-06-10',12,500),(7,'Decking','2022-06-25',150,1450),(8,'Compost and Stones','2022-05-29',20,780),(9,'Trees and Shrubs','2022-06-10',15,400),(10,'Garden Decor','2022-06-10',2,1250),(11,'Lawn Care','2022-06-25',10,400),
