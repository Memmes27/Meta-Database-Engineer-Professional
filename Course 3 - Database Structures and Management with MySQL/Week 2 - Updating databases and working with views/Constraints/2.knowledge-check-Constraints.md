# Knowledge check: Constraints

1. Identify the main types of constraints in a MySQL database. Select all that apply.
   - Domain constraints
   - Key constraints
   - Referential integrity constraints
   ```
   Answer: All options (Domain, Key, & Referential Integrity constraints).
   Explanation:
   - Domain constraint restricts the values of attributes in the table
   - Defining Key constraints is an essential part of the database design process to ensure reliable data and unique records.
   - Referential integrity requires that a foreign key must have a matching unique key, or it must be null. This means that the reference between a table row and another table must be valid.
   ```

2. Identify the constraints that are commonly used in SQL. Select all that apply.
   ```SQL
   - NOT NULL
   - UNIQUE
   - PRIMARY KEY
   ```
   ```
   Answer: All options (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY)
   Explanation:
   - The NOT NULL constraint ensures that a column in a table cannot have a NULL value
   - The UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a column are different
   - The PRIMARY KEY constraint is an essential constraint of a NOT NULL and UNIQUE value to identify records in unique way in a table
   ```

3. True or False: The CHECK constraint ensures that the value in a column satisfies a specific condition.

   - True
   - False
   ```
   Answer: True
   Explanation: The CHECK constraint ensures that the value in a column satisfies a specific condition.
   ```

4. True or False: Constraints can be specified only when the table is created with the CREATE TABLE statement.

   - False
   - True

   ```
   Answer: False
   Explanation: Constraints can be specified when the table is created with the CREATE TABLE statement, or after the table is created with the ALTER TABLE statement.
   ```

5. True or False: This table structure indicated that the "Phonenumber" column is both NOT NULL and UNIQUE.

   - True
   - False

   ```
   Answer: True
   Explanation: This table has a NOT NULL constraint on the PhoneNumber. This means that every customer must have a phone number. It also has a UNIQUE key assigned to the PhoneNumber column, which means the phone number must be unique for each customer.
   ```
