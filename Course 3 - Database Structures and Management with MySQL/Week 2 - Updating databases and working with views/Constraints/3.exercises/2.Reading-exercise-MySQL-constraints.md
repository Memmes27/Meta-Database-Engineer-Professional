# Reading exercise: MySQL constraints (Optional)

### PRACTICE USING MYSQL CONSTRAINTS
Mangata and Gallo is a jewelry store that specializes in special occasions like engagements, weddings and anniversaries in Texas. The company's database contains several tables of data, including the 'Staff' table that contains information about the Staff ID, the full name and the phone number. 

## Instructions
To complete this exercise, keep MySQL terminal open from the previous lab, or use MySQL on your own machine. To install MySQL on your own machine you can follow the instructions provided in the link in the additional resources item in the first module.

## Prerequisites

To complete this lab, you must have already created the Mangata and Gallo database in MySQL so that you can create the required tables inside of it. If you do not have the database, then you can create it in MySQL using the following instructions.

The code to create and use the database is as follows:

1. Create a database

```SQL 

CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS Mangata_Gallo;

```
2. Use database

```SQL
USE Mangata_Gallo;

```
## Tasks

**Task 1:**
Create the Staff table with the following PRIMARY KEY and NOT NULL constraints:
- Staff ID should be INT, NOT NULL and PRIMARY KEY
- PhoneNumber should be INT, NOT NULL and UNIQUE 
- FullName: VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL

**To create the Staff table in MySQL, you can use the CREATE TABLE Staff, followed by the StaffID, PhoneNumber and FullName columns, and the related constraints as shown below.**


```SQL 
CREATE TABLE Staff (
StaffID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
PhoneNumber INT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
FullName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL);   
``` 
Once you execute the above query, you should be able to view the table structure by running the following query:

```SQL
SHOW COLUMNS FROM Staff;
```

As expected, the StaffID is set to Primary Key (PRI) and the PhoneNumber to Unique (UNI). Also, notice that all columns are set to NOT NULL (NO), so all columns in the table must have a value to complete the registration of any new staff record.

**Task 2:** 
Create the 'ContractInfo' table with the following key and domain constraints:
- Contract ID should be INT, NOT NULL and PRIMARY KEY
- StaffID should be INT, NOT NULL. 
- Salary should be DECIMAL (7,2), NOT NULL.
- Location should be VARCHAR (50) NOT NULL with DEFAULT = "Texas". 
- StaffType should be VARCHAR (20) NOT NULL and should accept a "Junior" or a "Senior" value.

**To create the ‘Contract info’ table, you can use the CREATE TABLE ContractInfo followed by the ContractID, StaffID, Salary and StaffType columns, and the related constraints as shown below.**

```SQL 
CREATE TABLE ContractInfo (
ContractID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
StaffID INT NOT NULL,
Salary Decimal(7, 2) NOT NULL,
Location VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT "Texas",
StaffType VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL CHECK (StaffType = "Junior" OR StaffType = "Senior"));
``` 

This query will create the ContractInfo table with suitable checks constraints. It creates a CHECK constraint on the "StaffType" column when the " ContractInfo " table is created. In this case, the CHECK constraint ensures that the StaffType of staff must be Junior or Senior. 

**Task 3:** 
Create a foreign key that links the Staff table with the ContractInfo table. In this example, you need to apply the referential integrity rule as follows:
- Link each member of staff in the Staff table to a specific contract in the Contract Info table. 
- Each staff ID existing in the 'Contract Info' table is expected to exist as well in the Staff table. 
- The staff ID in the 'Contract Info' table should be defined as a foreign key to reference the Staff ID in the Staff table.

**To create the relationship between the Staff table and the Contract Info table, run the following SQL query with the foreign key constraint:**
```SQL
ALTER TABLE ContractInfo
ADD CONSTRAINT FK_StaffID_ContractInfo
FOREIGN KEY (StaffID) REFERENCES Staff(StaffID);
```
Once you execute the query, you should be able to view the table structure by running the following query:

```SQL
SHOW COLUMNS FROM ContractInfo;
```
