# Self review: Working with constraints

1. True or False: The following syntax applies the foreign key constraint in the Bookings table to reference the CustomerID in the Customers table.
   ``` SQL
   CREATE TABLE Bookings(
   BookingID INT PRIMARY KEY, 
   CustomerID INT NOT NULL, 
   BookingDate DATE NOT NULL, 
   FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Bookings (CustomerID)
   );
   ```
   - True
   - False
   ```
   Answer: False
   Explanation: The foreign key constraint should reference the Customers table as follows: REFERENCES Customers (CustomerID);
   ```

2. Text match. Creating a column name with a unique constraint requires defining that column as UNIQUE
   - UNIQUE
   - NOT NULL
   - NOT NULL UNIQUE
   ```
   Answer: UNIQUE
   Explanation: The NOT NULL is not required for the UNIQUE constraint. Only, the UNIQUE keyword is required to define the column as a unique constraint. 
   ```

3. Identify which of the following statements about constraints are correct. Select all that apply.
   - Constraints can be declared when you create a table.
   - Constraints can be deleted from a table.
   - Constraints can be changed and modified within a table.

   ```
   Answer: All Options
   Explanation:
   - Constraints can be declared when the table is created with the CREATE TABLE statement, or after the table is created with the ALTER TABLE statement.
   - Constraints can be deleted using the ALTER TABLE statement.
   - Constraints can be declared when the table is created with the CREATE TABLE statement. They can also be changed and modified when the table is created with the ALTER TABLE statement.
   ```

4. True or False: You can create multiple foreign key constraints in the same table in MySQL

   - True
   - False

   ```SQL Answer
   Answer: True
   Explanation: You can create multiple foreign keys in the same table in MySQL.
   ```

5. Which constraint type is used to limit the quantity of orders in the following SQL statement?
   ```SQL
   CREATE TABLE Orders ( 
   OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY, 
   ItemID INT NOT NULL, 
   ClientID INT NOT NULL, 
   Quantity INT NOT NULL CHECK (Quantity < 4), 
   Cost DECIMAL(6,2) NOT NULL, 
   FOREIGN KEY (ClientID) REFERENCES Clients (ClientID), 
   FOREIGN KEY (ItemID) REFERENCES Items (ItemID) 
   );
   ```
   
   - Key constraint
   - Domain constraint
   - Referential constraint
     
   ```
   Answer: Domain constraint
   Explanation: A SQL CHECK constraint is used to limit the value range that can be placed in the Quantity column. This is how a Domain constraint can be specified on a table.
   ```
