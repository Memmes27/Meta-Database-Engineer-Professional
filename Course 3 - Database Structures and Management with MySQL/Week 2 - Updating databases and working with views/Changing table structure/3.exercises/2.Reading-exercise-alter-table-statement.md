# Reading exercise: REPLACE INTO statement (Optional)

### Practice working with the REPLACE INTO statement
Let’s apply what you have learned about the REPLACE INTO statement in different situations.  

Let's begin by exploring the following ‘Starters’ table structure shown from the ‘Little Lemon’ database. 

It consists of three columns/fields

The ‘StarterName’ set as a primary key,

The ‘Cost,’

And the ‘StarterType’ set as default = “Mediterranean”

## Instructions
To complete this exercise, keep MySQL terminal open from the previous lab, or use MySQL on your own machine. To install MySQL on your own machine you can follow the instructions provided in the link in the additional resources item in the first module.  

## Prerequisites

In case you don't have the database or Starters table, you can get it by copying/pasting the following code in the MySQL terminal. 

1. The code to create the database is as follows: 

```SQL 

CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS little_lemon;

USE little_lemon; 

CREATE TABLE Starters(StarterName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, Cost Decimal(3,2), StaterType VARCHAR(100) DEFAULT 'Mediterranean');

```
## Tasks

**Task 1:**
Use the REPLACE statement to insert a new data record with the following details:
The ‘StarterName’ = Cheese bread 
The ‘Cost’ = 9.50 and 
The ‘StarterType’ = Indian

```SQL 

REPLACE INTO Starters (
StarterName, Cost, 
StarterType) VALUES ("Cheese bread", 9.50, "Indian");
``` 

**Task 2: Use the REPLACE statement to change the cost of the Cheese bread from $9.50 to $9.75.**


```SQL 
REPLACE INTO Starters SET StarterName = "Cheese bread", Cost=9.75, StarterType="Indian";
```
