# Exercise: Working with constraints




## Lab Instructions  

Mangata and Gallo is a jewelry store that specializes in special occasions like engagements, weddings and anniversaries. The jewelry company primarily operates online and has a small storefront in Austin, Texas with an atelier attached for browsing. The company approached you to create three tables for their database called 'Clients', 'Orders' and 'Items' respectively. Each database must have all necessary constraints applied as specified in each task.

The 'Clients' table contains the Client ID, full name and phone number of each client.

The Orders table contains information about each order's Order ID, Client ID, Item ID, Quantity and Cost.

The Items table contains information about the Item ID, Item name, and Item price.

The relationship between the three table is illustrated in the following entity relationship diagram (ER-D).

### Prerequisites  

To complete this lab, you must have the Mangata and Gallo database in MySQL, so that you can create the three tables within it. If you do not have the database, then create it in MySQL using the following instructions.

The code to create and use the database is as follows:

1: Create database

```SQL 

CREATE DATABASE Mangata_Gallo;
``` 

2: Use database 

```SQL 

USE Mangata_Gallo;

```  
 

## This activity aims to achieve the following objective:    

 
1. Apply commonly used types of constraints in MySQL.
 
 

## Tasks Instructions 

Please attempt the following tasks: 

**Task 1:** Create the Clients table with the following columns and constraints.

ClientID: INT, NOT NULL and PRIMARY KEY

FullName: VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL

PhoneNumber: INT, NOT NULL and UNIQUE

The expected structure of the table should be the same as the following screenshot (assuming that you have created and populated the tables correctly.)

```SQL Answer

CREATE TABLE Clients (
ClientID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
FullName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
PhoneNumber INT NOT NULL UNIQUE);
SHOW COLUMNS from Clients;
```

**Task 2:** Create the Items table with the following attributes and constraints:

ItemID: INT, NOT NULL and PRIMARY KEY

ItemName: VARCHAR(100) and NOT NULL

Price: Decimal(5,2) and NOT NULL

The expected structure of the table should be the same as the following screenshot (assuming that you have created and populated the tables correctly.)

 ```SQL Answer

CREATE TABLE Items (
ItemID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
ItemName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
Price DECIMAL(5,2) NOT NULL);
Show Columns from Items;
```
**Task 3:** Create the Orders table with the following constraints.

OrderID: INT, NOT NULL and PRIMARY KEY

ClientID: INT, NOT NULL and FOREIGN KEY

ItemID: INT, NOT NULL and FOREIGN KEY

Quantity: INT, NOT NULL and maximum allowed items in each order 3 only

COST Decimal(6,2) and NOT NULL

The expected structure of the table should be the same as the following screenshot (assuming that you have created and populated the tables correctly.)

 ```SQL Answer
CREATE TABLE ORDERS (
OrderID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, 
ClientID INT NOT NULL, ItemID INT NOT NULL,
Quantity INT NOT NULL CHECK(Quantity <=3),
Cost DECIMAL(6,2) NOT NULL,
FOREIGN KEY (ClientID) REFERENCES Clients (ClientID),
FOREIGN KEY (ItemID) REFERENCES Items (ItemID));

 ```
