# Self review: MySQL REPLACE statement

1. True or False: The REPLACE command in MySQL can be used in place of both the INSERT and UPDATE commands.
   - True
   - False
   ```
   Answer: True
   Explanation: The MySQL REPLACE command is an extension to the SQL Standard,
                and it can be used to insert data in a table however in a different way than
                the standard INSERT and UPDATE commands.
   ```

2. True or False: The REPLACE command functions in a similar manner to the INSERT command. The key difference is that it deletes the exisiting record of data and inserts the new one if it finds a duplicate key.
   - True
   - False
   ```
   Answer: True
   Explanation: The REPLACE command works like the INSERT command.
                The key difference is that it deletes the existing record of data
                and inserts the new one if it finds a duplicate key. 
   ```

3. True or False: You can expect the following REPLACE statement to be declined when executed as there is a conflict with the exisiting primary key (ID=7).
   
   ```SQL
   REPLACE INTO Orders (OrderID, ClientID, ProductID , Quantity, Cost) VALUES (7, "Cl1", "P1", 10, 600);
   ```

   - True
   - False
   ```
   Answer: False
   Explanation: When executed, the REPLACE statement deletes the conflicting row
                that causes the duplicate key error from the table. It inserts the new
                record of data into the table instead of the deleted one.
   ```

4. You need to update the record of the Order with the ID of 8 in the following "Orders" table with a new client ID of CL3 instead of CL1. Select the correct REPLACE statement to complete this task.

   ```SQL Answer
   1. REPLACE INTO Orders SET ClientID = "CL3" WHERE OrderID = 8;
   2. REPLACE INTO Orders SET OrderID = 8, ClientID = "CL3", ProductID = "P1", Quantity = 15, Cost = 150;
   3. REPLACE INTO Orders SET ClientID = "CL3", ProductID = "P1", Quantity = 15, Cost =150 WHERE OrderID = 8;
   ```

   ```
   Answer: Option 2 - REPLACE INTO Orders SET OrderID = 8, ClientID = "CL3", ProductID = "P1", Quantity = 15, Cost = 150;
   Explanation: This is the correct replace statement to update the record of
                Order ID = 8 with a new client ID of CL3 instead of CL1.
   ```

5. True or False: The REPLACE statement only works if you set values for all the table columns
   - True
   - False
   ```
   Answer: False
   Explanation: The Replace statement works even if you only include some of the values.
                The statement sets all the missing columns to NULL values. 
   ```
